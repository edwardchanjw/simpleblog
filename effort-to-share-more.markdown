Testing post and write more, share more, effort to collaborative knowledge and baseline on react and node.js. Especially react, probably hooks is more idea now?)

Now I am writing a SaaS so I am probably going to blog on more:

- Simple Auth0 and Firebase API+SPA, or only machine to machine authentication configuration without code change for express/nestjs project. To have a baseline way for implement (https://github.com/nestjs/docs.nestjs.com/issues/75), probably either passport or simple middleware
- Workflow related saas: Zapier like probably n8n, tideflow
- Express boilerplate(To discuss whether follow convention of NestJS,  https://softwareontheroad.com/ideal-nodejs-project-structure, https://github.com/async-labs/saas)
- React's Awesome sample of grid mode of components, swap image wall to IOT wall by configuration, not code change, component type development benefit . (Dashboard like)
